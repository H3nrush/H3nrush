                <h1>My life in the digital and gaming world:</h1>

                I have been very interested in console games since I was a child, until my
                 father bought me my first <strong>Sega</strong> console and I started playing my first favorite
                  game <strong>(Super Mario, Sonic)</strong> in the third grade of school. Later, with the release
                   of new consoles, my interest in high <strong>graphics games</strong> increased and I started with
                   <strong>Playstation 2</strong> . Besides these hobbies, I was very interested in <strong>astronomy</strong> and
                     <strong>alchemy</strong>. It was in this way that I tried to turn to hand-selling so that I could
                      buy <strong>my first computer</strong>. In this way, I could get the information I needed on the 
                      Internet and I could install my favorite games. Later, by getting to know <strong>cmd</strong>  and 
                     <strong> Windows terminal codes</strong>, <strong> HTML CSS</strong>, my interest in programming and script writing
                       increased day by day. The excitement of programming and destructive fertilizers 
                       is really high for both of us. I first entered the dark part of the digital world.
                        I mostly use bat formats to create malicious files so that I can create an autorun
                         in flash and copy this file to the Windows startup folder, and that's how I <strong>started
                            writing viruses.</strong> Every day that passed, these jobs became boring for me, and as a
                           result, I was looking for income. My brother was a <strong>smartphone software repairer</strong> 
                           and he was the one who introduced me to the smartphone repair and maintenance profession.
                            It was here that my work changed from demolition to maintenance and repair, which was
                             also enjoyable because I was using knowledge that I used to use in the <i>wrong way</i> , but
                              this time I could use it in the right way and also <b> make money</b>. . I was in a difficult 
                              and difficult life situation and <i>I couldn't continue my school at all</i>, or I had to
                               work, or I was studying, and the situation was such that studying was of no use to
                                me and it prevented my progress.
                                I dropped out of school and started <b>teaching myself</b> 
                                During the day, I was working to provide a way for myself to escape from my life full  
                                 of risk, and that's when I <b>traveled to France</b> . In France, I had a lot of luck to be able
                                  to make a good field and a good job for myself, so I started looking for <strong>web programming</strong>.
                                   Because I was already familiar with <strong>HTML,CSS</strong> . <b> I must say that I have more experience in
                                    computers than my age</b>. I almost started this adventure when I was 9 years old and I am still
                                     20 years old and I continue. I am always trying to show my best quality to others with my
                                      passion and belief in myself. . . !
